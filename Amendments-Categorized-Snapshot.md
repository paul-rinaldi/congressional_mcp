Date: 2025-09-16
Scope: Representative categorization of retrieved House (HAMDT) and Senate (SAMDT) amendments from the initial pages we pulled for the 118th and 119th Congress. Includes examples and links.

### Key Takeaway
- The bulk of amendments surfaced fall into a few clusters: energy/SPR and leasing policy, education/parental rights, government speech/oversight, immigration/detention, and budget/process. No small-business grant/AI/data center items appeared in the last-60-day search window for amendments.

## Notes and Limits
- This snapshot reflects the first retrieved pages and representative items. Many adjacent amendments in sequences share near-identical themes with varying language.
- No last‑60‑day amendments matched the topics: small business grants/funding, artificial intelligence, or data centers.

## Options to Deepen This View
- Expand beyond amendments to include **bills** and **committee** activity (often where small business funding/AI/data center items appear)
- Increase time window (90–180 days) and keyword set (e.g., SBA 7(a)/504, microloans; AI safety/governance; datacenter siting/power/interconnect)

If you want this categorized view regenerated with a wider scope, say "expand to bills, 180 days" and your priority keywords.
