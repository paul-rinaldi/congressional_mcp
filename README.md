Currently this only hits the /amendments APIs, yet there are maybe 10 more /top-level endpoints we could build against

## Getting Started: Your First Congressional AI Assistant

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:

- Cursor IDE installed (or use Claude Code, Gemini Cli, Codex Cli)
- Python 3.8+ (or tell cursor to install this, ðŸ’» for advanced users I recommend uv)
- A Congress.gov API key (free at api.congress.gov/sign-up)

### Step 1: Clone and Setup the Project

```bash

# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-org/congress-api-mcp.git

cd congress-api-mcp

# Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Step 2: Configure Your API Key

Update your Cursor MCP configuration at ~/.cursor/mcp.json:

```json

{

  "mcpServers": {

    "congress-api": {

      "command": "python",

      "args": ["/path/to/congress_api_mcp.py"],

      "env": {

        "CONGRESSIONAL_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"

      }

    }

  }

}

```

### Step 3: Restart Cursor and Start Querying

Once configured, restart Cursor. You'll now have access to congressional data through natural language queries.

## Real-World Business Use Cases and Examples

### Healthcare Compliance Monitoring

Business Context: A healthcare executive needs to track amendments to the Affordable Care Act that might impact reimbursement policies.

AI Query:

```

"Show me recent amendments to healthcare legislation in the 118th Congress that mention Medicare or Medicaid"

```

What Happens Behind the Scenes:

1. Cursor's AI parses your natural language query

2. MCP routes the request to our Congress API server

3. The server translates to: search_amendments(query="Medicare OR Medicaid", congress=118)

4. API call: GET /v3/amendment?query=Medicare+OR+Medicaid&congress=118&limit=20

5. Results formatted and returned for business analysis

### Financial Services Regulatory Tracking

Business Context: A fintech CFO wants to monitor SEC-related amendments that could affect capital requirements.

AI Query:

```

"Find amendments sponsored by senators from New York that relate to financial regulation or banking in the current congress"

```

Technical Deep Dive: The system uses advanced text matching:

```python

# Behind the scenes matching logic

def search_amendments_by_text(self, query: str, congress: Optional[int] = None):

    amendments = self.list_amendments(congress=congress, limit=250)

    matching = []

    query_lower = query.lower()

    for amendment in amendments.amendments:

        if (amendment.description and query_lower in amendment.description.lower()) or \

           (amendment.purpose and query_lower in amendment.purpose.lower()):

            matching.append(amendment)

    return AmendmentsResponse(amendments=matching[:50])

```

### Manufacturing and Trade Policy Intelligence

Business Context: A manufacturing CEO needs to track trade-related amendments affecting supply chains.

AI Query:

```

"What amendments to trade legislation have been proposed this year that mention China or tariffs?"

```

## Advanced Technical Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting and Error Handling

Congress.gov API enforces a 5,000 requests/hour limit. Our implementation includes sophisticated rate limiting:

```python

class HttpClient:

    def checkrate_limit(self) -> None:

        current_time = time.time()

        # Reset counter hourly

        if current_time - self.rate_limit_info.hour_start_time >= 3600:

            self.rate_limit_info.requests_this_hour = 0

            self.rate_limit_info.hour_start_time = current_time

        if self.rate_limit_info.requests_this_hour >= self.config.rate_limit_per_hour:

            raise Exception(f"Rate limit exceeded: {self.rate_limit_info.requests_this_hour} requests this hour")

```

### Data Modeling with Pydantic

We use Pydantic for robust data validation and type safety:

```python

class Amendment(BaseModel):

    number: int

    congress: int

    type: str  # "HAMDT", "SAMDT", "SUAMDT"

    description: Optional[str] = None

    purpose: Optional[str] = None

    latestAction: Optional[LatestAction] = None

    sponsors: Optional[List[Sponsor]] = None

    cosponsors: Optional[Cosponsors] = None

    actions: Optional[Actions] = None

    textVersions: Optional[TextVersions] = None

```

This ensures data integrity and provides excellent IDE support with autocompletion.

### MCP Tool Registration

The MCP server exposes tools through a clean registration system:

```python

def create_amendment_tools(service: AmendmentService) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:

    return [

        {

            "name": "list_amendments",

            "description": "List amendments with optional filtering",

            "inputSchema": {

                "type": "object",

                "properties": {

                    "congress": {"type": "integer", "description": "Congress number"},

                    "amendment_type": {

                        "type": "string",

                        "enum": ["HAMDT", "SAMDT", "SUAMDT"]

                    },

                    "limit": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 250}

                }

            }

        }

        # ... additional tools

    ]

```

## Business Impact and ROI Considerations

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
Traditional Approach:

- Dedicated legislative analyst: $80,000-$120,000/year

- Third-party monitoring services: $5,000-$15,000/month

- Manual research time: 10-20 hours/week

- Risk of missing critical updates

AI-Powered Approach:

- Development setup: One-time cost (~$500 for API access)

- Maintenance: Minimal (mostly dependency updates)

- Query response time: Instant

- Coverage: Comprehensive and automated

ROI: Most organizations see payback within 1-2 months through reduced compliance costs and faster response to regulatory changes.

### Integration with Business Workflows

The beauty of this approach is its seamless integration into existing workflows:

1. Compliance Teams: Automated monitoring of relevant legislation

2. Legal Departments: Quick research capabilities for regulatory analysis

3. Executive Leadership: Real-time alerts on critical legislative developments

4. Product Teams: Impact assessment for regulatory changes

## Next Steps: Expanding Congressional Intelligence

### Phase 1: Additional Congressional Endpoints

The MCP server now exposes every top-level route published at [api.congress.gov](https://api.congress.gov/). Each resource is wrapped in a dedicated tool trio that covers listing, direct retrieval, and nested subresources. Supported resources include:

- `bill`
- `summaries`
- `congress`
- `committee`
- `committee-report`
- `committee-print`
- `committee-meeting`
- `hearing`
- `member`
- `nomination`
- `treaty`
- `crsreport`
- `law`
- `house-communication`
- `senate-communication`
- `house-requirement`
- `house-vote`
- `congressional-record`
- `daily-congressional-record`
- `bound-congressional-record`

The tooling mirrors the amendment experience and keeps parameters consistent across endpoints. For example:

```json
{
  "list_bill": {
    "params": {"limit": 5}
  },
  "get_bill": {
    "path_segments": [118, "hr", 2670]
  },
  "get_bill_subresource": {
    "path_segments": [118, "hr", 2670],
    "subresource": "text"
  }
}
```

Because the subresource tool accepts any additional path, the same pattern works for bill actions, committee attachments, House communication requirements, and other nested resources without creating hundreds of bespoke MCP tools.

## Testing Examples Across Endpoints

Run `pytest -k tool_execution` to validate amendment, bill, and communication requirement workflows with mocked responses. The integration tests exercise:

1. **Amendment listing** â€“ Ensures the amendment-specific service still parses structured data into Pydantic models.
2. **Generic list endpoints** â€“ Verifies the dynamic resource service can call `/v3/bill` (or any other route) with arbitrary query parameters.
3. **Subresource traversal** â€“ Demonstrates how to reach nested routes such as `/v3/bill/118/hr/2670/text` using the shared subresource tool.
4. **Hyphenated resources** â€“ Confirms endpoints like `/v3/house-requirement/100/matching-communications` resolve correctly through the dynamic tooling.

Component tests cover configuration, HTTP client behaviour, amendment parsing, and the generic resource builder to keep SOLID boundaries intact.
