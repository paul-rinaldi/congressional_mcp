## Congressional Amendments Watch: Last 60 Days (Small Business Funding, AI, Data Centers)

Date: 2025-09-16
Audience: Small business owners and operators

### Summary
- **No relevant federal amendments found in the last 60 days** mentioning:
  - **Small business** grants/funding (e.g., SBA, grants, loans)
  - **Artificial intelligence** (AI)
  - **Data centers**

### Scope of this check
- **What**: Amendments (House and Senate) only
- **Where**: 119th Congress (current)
- **When**: Past 60 days from the date above
- **Topics**: "small business", "SBA", "grant", "grants", "loan", "loans", "artificial intelligence", "AI", "data center", "data centers"

### What this means for business owners
- There were **no new amendment proposals** in the past two months that would directly:
  - Create or expand federal **grants/loans for small businesses**
  - Regulate or fund **artificial intelligence** initiatives
  - Incentivize or restrict **data center** development

This does not rule out activity in other vehicles (e.g., full bills, committee drafts, agency programs) or older amendments outside the 60‑day window.

### Recommended next steps
- **Broaden the watch** beyond amendments:
  - Track new and advancing **bills** touching small business funding, AI, or data center policy
  - Monitor **committee** markups and reports (House Small Business; House Energy & Commerce; Senate Small Business & Entrepreneurship; Senate Commerce)
- **Widen the timeframe** to 90–180 days to catch items introduced before recesses/continuing resolutions
- **Expand keywords** (examples):
  - Small business: "SBA", "startup", "microloan", "504", "7(a)", "grant program", "technical assistance"
  - AI: "machine learning", "compute", "model", "algorithmic", "foundation model", "safety", "NIST"
  - Data centers: "datacenter", "hyperscale", "server farm", "power capacity", "interconnection", "cooling", "site development"
- **Practical actions now**:
  - Check current SBA and grants listings at [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/) and [grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov/)
  - Coordinate with local **SBDC** or **PTAC/APEX Accelerator** for procurement and grant readiness
  - Prepare standard compliance documentation (SAM registration, capability statement) to move quickly if a program opens
